# 5-year career plans
This document:

a) outlines [the process](#the-process) for creating a self-directed career

b) describes [the first step](#the-first-step) to take

c) has a section for each person's [career plan](#current-plan)

## The process
To create opportunities and self-drive a meaningful career in tech, iterate:
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph learn[Experiential Learning]

        subgraph Experience[3. Get hands on]
          Cloud[Big Cloud]
          Containers
          APIs 
          Niche[Niche that interests you]
        end

        subgraph Network[4. Network]
          Mentors
          Meetups
        end
    end

    subgraph brainstorm[Reflect]

        subgraph Identify[1. Identify]
          Interests
          Passions
        end

        subgraph Goals[2. Set goals]
          Quarterly
          Yearly
        end
    end



    Identify --> Goals
    Experience --> Network
    learn --> brainstorm
    brainstorm --> learn
```

## The first step
Brainstorm your current understanding of your Interests, Passions and goals.
Share with Paul and the group. 
The more we know about each other, the more we can help each other.

## Current plan
_Note: If you like how I formatted my information, I have documented two utilities to help you [automate the formatting](automation.md). You are very welcome to use either or neither approach._
