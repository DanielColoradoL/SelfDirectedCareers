# 5-year career plans
## The process
To create opportunities and self-drive a meaningful career in tech:
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Identify[1. Identify]
      Interests
      Passions
    end

    subgraph Goals[2. Set goals]
      Quarterly
      Yearly
    end


    subgraph Experience[3. Get hands on]
      Cloud[Big Cloud]
      Containers
      Language[Programming language]
      JSON
    end

    subgraph Network[4. Network]
      Mentors
      Meetups
    end

    Identify --> Goals
    Goals --> Experience
    Experience --> Network
    Network --> Identify
```

## The first step
Brainstorm your current understanding of your Interests, Passions and goals.
Share with Paul and us. 
The more we know about each other, the more we can help each other.

## Your current understanding
I have documented utilities that can help you partially automate the creation of your markdown career table.
One of the utilities is [a few-shot prompt](automation.md#use-genai-to-create-your-table) that was tested against ChatGPT 3.5. 
The other utility is [a Python script](automation.md#use-python-lists-and-pandas) that has dependencies on `pandas` and `tabulate`. 
You are very welcome to use either or neither approach.
